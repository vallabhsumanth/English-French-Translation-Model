# English-French-Translation-Model
This project implements a translation model that converts English sentences to French, leveraging transformer-based language representations for feature extraction. The model is built using TensorFlow and Hugging Face's transformer library. It employs a pre-trained BERT model for feature extraction and a custom-trained model for translation.
